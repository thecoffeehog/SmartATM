# SmartATM
This program was developed for educational and learnig purposes using JAVA.

This is a ATM stimulation program with voice assistance for visually disabled (blind).  

This is one of the mini projects developed by me to practice the core java concepts like Exception Handling, Inheritance, 
Polymorphism, Data hiding etc.

I have used Swing to develop the user interface of the program.

I have also used AWT concepts alongside Swing for implementations like mouse Hover effects.

I have also developed this program as so that it uses the system look and feel and thus avoids using the boring Swing buttons 
which have not been updated since long time.

The voice used in this program was made available by the text-to-speech conversion tool provided by oddcast 
(http://oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php)

I converted the .mp3 files to .wav using conversion tool provided at http://media.io
